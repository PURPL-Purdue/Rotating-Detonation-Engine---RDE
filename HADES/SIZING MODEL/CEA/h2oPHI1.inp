!     COMBUSTION OF HYDROGEN IN OXYGEN
!     (a)  Combustion or assigned-enthalpy-and-pressure problem (hp).
!     (b)  Fuels is  H2  at 298.15 K. The oxidant is O2 at 298K.
!     (c)  Oxidant-to-fuel weight ratio is specified interms of phi=1
!     (d)  Mixture enthalpy is calculated from reactant values given in 
!          thermo.lib. This is because data for these species are given in
!          thermo.lib and the species names match exactly.
!     (e)  product species considered is  H2O  ('only' dataset).
!          Note:  these species names must match those used in thermo.lib.
!     (f)  Assigned pressure is 1atm.
!     (g)  Mixture properties are to be printed in SI units (siunits).
!     (h)  Mole fractions > 1.e-15 are to be in e-format (trace=1.e-15).
